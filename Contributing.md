## Topic for Collaboration: Innovation vs. Pollution

Modern technology plays a dual role in sustainability—both as a challenge and a solution.  
**Vertical farming**, for example, uses advanced sensors, automation, and LED lighting to grow food efficiently in stacked layers. This approach minimizes land use, recycles water, and reduces transportation emissions.

In contrast, **coal-burning power plants**—once the backbone of industrial energy—remain a major source of carbon emissions and environmental degradation. Transitioning from these outdated systems to cleaner, tech-driven solutions is essential for a sustainable future.
