# 🌍 Sustainable Electronics and Various Environmental Discussions - Worldwide

This repository is a collection of **questions, prompts, and resources** designed to spark conversations about **electronics and environmental sustainability**. It covers the entire lifecycle of electronics—from materials and production to usage, disposal, innovation, and future policies.  

<br>

Environmental degradation is a central concern throughout these discussions, as electronic systems rely heavily on resource extraction, energy consumption, and waste streams that can damage ecosystems and human health if left unaddressed.

---

## 🎯 Purpose
The goal is to **raise awareness** and encourage **collaborative learning** about how electronics affect our planet, and what we can do to make technology more sustainable.  
By examining environmental degradation alongside technological progress, this repository emphasizes the importance of reducing harm, improving accountability, and designing electronics with long-term ecological impact in mind.  

This repo is useful for:
- Teachers & students  
- Workshop leaders  
- Researchers  
- Anyone curious about sustainable electronics

### 📂 Philippines Environment → Photos

- **General Info:** This collection documents **environmental conditions in the Philippines**, highlighting the **waste management challenges** that affect local communities. Poorly managed dumpsites and the lack of sanitary landfills contribute to pollution and serious health issues. Some residents burn their trash, which worsens air quality and increases health problems such as asthma, affecting residents like Jhun and Peter. 
- **Electronics Application::** What can we do to manage this waste?
- **Photographer / Author:** Jhun Alfred Reblando  
- **Format:** Photos for **educational and awareness purposes**, suitable for **environmental studies, sustainability projects, or community programs**.

## ♻️ Recycling Resources

If you’re looking for ways to responsibly recycle items and reduce waste, here are some helpful resources and programs:

- **[TerraCycle](https://www.terracycle.com/en-CA)** – Offers recycling programs for hard-to-recycle waste such as packaging, electronics, and personal care products. Available in Canada and internationally.  
- **[Recycle My Electronics](https://recyclemyelectronics.ca/)** – A Canadian program for safely recycling electronic devices, from computers and phones to printers and TVs.  
- **[Call2Recycle](https://www.call2recycle.ca/)** – A free battery and cellphone recycling program available across Canada.  
- **[Earth911 Recycling Search](https://search.earth911.com/)** – A global directory that helps you find local drop-off locations for specific materials.  
- **[Packaging Stewardship Programs](https://www.environnement.gouv.qc.ca/matieres/emballages/)** – Province-specific recycling guidelines for accepted materials and collection schedules in Canada.  

> 💡 **Tip:** Many municipalities also provide recycling apps or websites that list accepted materials, pickup schedules, and drop-off depots for hazardous or electronic waste.

### 🔄 Circular Economy in Electronics

The circular economy model emphasizes designing electronics for longevity, repairability, and reuse. Instead of a linear “use and discard” approach, materials and components are kept in circulation through repair, refurbishment, and recycling.
